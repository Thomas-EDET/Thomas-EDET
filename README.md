# Hi, I'm Thomas EDETðŸ‘‹

I'm starting a new chapter focused on **Web3 development** and **security**.  
I'm going **all in**: building, learning, and growing my skills every day.

ðŸ”¹ Launching myself into the **Web3 bug bounty** world  
ðŸ”¹ Sharing my progress, tips, and projects openly

If you're into Web3, security, or just want to follow a builder's journey from the ground up â€” you're welcome to join me!
